    <h1>About</h1>
    <br>

    <p>This is a blog.<br>
    As you could probably guess from the name of it, it's about Tech.<br>
    But not just any Tech - no, no, no - it's about <strong>Cool</strong> Tech.<br>
    And let's be serious about this now. Sure, there may be other blogs about Tech. <br>
    But realistically, how many of them where coded by a 19 year old still living in his parents house? <br>
    Okay, probably most of them. Fair. <br>
    But how many of them use a SQL database to store the blog posts? <br>
    Okay, probably most of them again. Fair, again. <br>
    But how many of them were written with the soul purpose of being
    used to impress a potential employer? <br>
    <strong>AH HUH!</strong> So there is something unique about mine!<br>
    Anyways, have a look around, make yourself at home. <br>
    Please pay extra attention to the Search and user authentication functionality - I spent way too long on them lol.
